Quest 2 Root
---
It is currently not possible to root a Quest 2 if you're on firmware newer than `v29.0.0.65.370.289987413`, which is 99.9% of headsets. You will need to wait for a new exploit to come out. Yes, we are working on it. No, it's not easy, nor do we know when it will be done.

If you are on `v29.0.0.65.370.289987413`, you can unlock the bootloader of your headset using https://github.com/darknight1050/quest-bootloader-unlocker and then possibly flash a patched boot image, however this hasn't been attempted.
