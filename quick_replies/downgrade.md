Downgrading
---
It’s not possible to downgrade your Quest headset’s firmware. The reason is that **Meta uses hardware-level security called _eFuses_**. Once the headset updates, these fuses are permanently “burned,” making it impossible to roll back to an older version. So, if your Quest has already updated, there’s no way to downgrade it. It's best to use the ADB command in <#1364918149404688454> to prevent yourself from getting further updates, making your headset more likely vulnerable to future exploits.
